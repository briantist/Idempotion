# Idempotion
[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/krw5r7k42j5v2wxq?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/briantist/idempotion)

Idempotion is a PowerShell module designed to allow use of DSC resources as imperative commands.

The idempotent nature of DSC resources is sometimes desirable in a scenario where generating static configurations tied to a specific node doesn't make sense.

Idempotion allows you to use existing, well-tested logic as part of scripts so you don't have to reinvent the wheel.

_More documentation coming soon._
