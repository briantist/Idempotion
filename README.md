# Idempotion
Idempotion is a PowerShell module designed to allow use of DSC resources as imperative commands.

The idempotent nature of DSC resources is sometimes desirable in a scenario where generating static configurations tied to a specific node doesn't make sense.

Idempotion allows you to use existing, well-tested logic as part of scripts so you don't have to reinvent the wheel.

_More documentation coming soon._
